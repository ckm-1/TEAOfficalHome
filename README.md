⚖️ The Five Expressions of TEA

All TEA initiatives operate through five integrated domains:

Technion — Technology, AI, infrastructure, and innovation

Econion — Sustainable economics, resources, and value systems

Terrion — Environmental stewardship, ecosystems, and climate

Spirion — Consciousness, education, values, and inner development

These expressions are not silos. They are interdependent lenses through which TEA evaluates and designs solutions.
